"""
Utilities to fake some PMT tools so that a python file from the documentation becomes
runnable in the local environment.


WHAT IT DOES:

    * `auto_run` works exactly as it does in pyodide, except for the variables deletions.
    * All other objects/functions act as sinks, swallowing any kind of access/calls
    without doing anything (hence, not returning any value either).


HOW TO USE IT:

    Just put the following snippet at the very top of the python file you wanna test:

    ```python
    # --- PYODIDE:ignore --- #
    # To put at the very top of the python file to test
    from toolbox import *
    ```


This file and the `pyodide_plot.py` one are also available through one of these PMT's scripts:

    python -m pyodide_mkdocs_theme --toolbox --plot
    python -m pyodide_mkdocs_theme --toolbox --plot -C
    python -m pyodide_mkdocs_theme -tPC
