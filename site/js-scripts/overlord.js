waitForClassesPoolReady()
/*

Can also be `waitForClassesPoolReady( (cbk)=>boolean )`, where cbk is supposed to be a synchronous
boolean provider:
    - `cbk` will be called when all the classes for the current page have been registered in
      CONFIG.CLASSES_POOL, for the current page.
    - If the callback returns a falsy value, it will be called again in the future (the caller
      is using `setTimeout`), until it returns true. This allows the use of asynchronous waiting
      logic if needed.


A (stupid) example, waiting 500ms between the classes registrations in CONFIG.CLASSES_POOL and
their use to build the objects in the page:

```javascript
const time = new Date()
waitForClassesPoolReady(_=> (new Date()-time) > 500 )
```
